T20 Cricket Data Analytics - Super 11 Dream Team Selection

Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Collection: Utilize the Bright Data web scraping tool to extract T20 cricket player statistics from the ESPN Cric Info website.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering using Python and Pandas to prepare the data for analysis.

3. Dream Team Selection: Apply data analytics techniques to select the best 11 players for a T20 cricket Dream Team based on various performance metrics.

4. Dashboard Creation: Build an interactive and visually informative dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to present key insights and facilitate stakeholder understanding.


Prerequisites:
Before you can run the code and replicate the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (3.7 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
JavaScript
Microsoft Power BI Desktop
Bright Data web scraping tool (or equivalent)



Procedure:
In this project, I utilized the Bright Data web scraping tool to extract valuable data from the Espn Cric Info website. It was essential to gather comprehensive information to form a super 11 dream team for T20 cricket.

Once I obtained the raw data, I turned to the powerful Pandas library in Python to perform a series of data transformations and cleaning operations. This step was crucial to ensure that the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

After cleaning and preparing the data, the next step was to create an engaging and informative dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. But first, DAX Calculations:

In Power BI, I utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) extensively to create calculated measures and columns. DAX allowed me to perform complex calculations and aggregations on the dataset. For example, I could calculate batting averages, strike rates, and economy rates for players. These DAX measures provided valuable insights into the performance of individual players and teams.

Interactive Dashboard:

The highlight of this project was the creation of an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard was designed to be visually informative and user-friendly. It featured various charts, graphs, and tables that showcased key insights from the data.

I used DAX measures and calculated columns to power dynamic visuals on the dashboard. For instance, I created a calculated column to determine a player's overall performance score, considering their batting and bowling statistics. This score was then used in various visualizations to help stakeholders identify top-performing players.

Overall, the combination of web scraping, data manipulation with Pandas, and the creation of a dynamic Power BI dashboard allowed me to effectively analyze T20 cricket data and form a super 11 dream team. This project not only showcased my data analytics skills but also provided valuable insights for stakeholders in the cricket world.
